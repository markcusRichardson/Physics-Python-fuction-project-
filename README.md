Physics Calculations with Python

This project is a Python-based physics calculator that I built as part of my Python 3 learning on Codecademy. 
It demonstrates basic physics formulas using Python functions, covering temperature conversion, force, energy, and work calculations.

What This Code Does
This script performs **four main physics calculations**:
1. Temperature Conversion** between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
2. Force Calculation** for a moving train.
3. Energy Calculation** using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.
4. Work Calculation** to measure energy exerted over a distance.
